/**
 * Utils Index

 * This file exports utility functions and helpers.

 * - Constants
 * - Helper functions
 * - Type guards
 * 
 * Export pattern:
 * export { formatDate, formatCurrency } from './formatters';
 * export { validateEmail, validatePhone } from './validators';
 * export * from './constants';
