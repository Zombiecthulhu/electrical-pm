# üì± Mobile Testing Guide

Complete guide for testing the mobile UI optimizations on real devices.

---

## üéØ Testing Objective

Verify that all mobile optimizations work correctly on real iPhone and Android devices across different screen sizes and orientations.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
# Backend (Terminal 1)
cd backend
npm start

# Frontend (Terminal 2)
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 2. Find Your Local IP Address

**Windows:**
```powershell
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
ifconfig
```
Look for "inet" under your active connection (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

### 3. Access from Mobile Device

**Requirements:**
- Mobile device on same WiFi network as computer
- Frontend running on port 3000
- Backend running on port 5000

**Access URL:**
```
http://YOUR_IP:3000
```
Example: `http://192.168.1.100:3000`

**If connection fails:**
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure both devices on same network
- Try disabling VPN
