## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Project Vision
Develop a comprehensive, modular project management system specifically tailored for electrical construction businesses. The system will serve as a centralized hub for managing projects, clients, documentation, team collaboration, and daily operations, inspired by industry-leading platforms like Procore and BuildingConnected, but customized for your specific business needs.

### Key Objectives
- Streamline project management workflows for electrical construction
- Centralize documentation, photos, and project data
- Enable real-time collaboration and daily logging
- Provide customizable, modular architecture for future expansion
- Build with cloud migration in mind (Google Cloud Platform)
- Create modern, clean, and intuitive user experience

### Development Approach
This system will be developed using AI-assisted coding ("vibe coding") with Cursor IDE. The architecture prioritizes modularity, security, and scalability from day one, even though initial deployment will be local/on-premise.

## 2. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Business Context
This is a custom internal tool for an electrical construction business. Unlike commercial software, this system can be tailored precisely to your workflows, terminology, and business processes without licensing costs or feature limitations.

### Target Users
- **Business Owner/Administrator** - Full system access and configuration
- **Project Managers** - Project oversight, client communication, reporting
- **Field Supervisors** - Daily logs, photo uploads, issue tracking
- **Office Staff** - Document management, quote preparation, scheduling
- **Electricians/Field Workers** - View assignments, submit timesheets, upload photos

### Core Philosophy

#### Modular Hub Architecture
The system is built around a central hub with independent, interchangeable modules. Each module can be added, removed, or customized without affecting others. This allows you to start simple and grow the system organically as needs evolve.

#### Progressive Implementation
Begin with the hub and 2-3 core modules, then systematically add functionality module by module. This approach reduces complexity, allows for learning and adjustment, and delivers value incrementally.

## Success Metrics

### Adoption Metrics
- Number of active users (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Percentage of projects managed in the system
- Daily logs submitted per project (target: 80%+ of workdays)
- Photos uploaded per project (indicates field usage)

### Efficiency Gains
- Time to create a quote (target: 50% reduction vs. manual process)
- Time to find a document (target: instant vs. minutes searching files)
- Reduction in duplicate data entry
- Faster project status visibility (real-time vs. weekly meetings)
